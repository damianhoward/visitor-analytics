/**
 * Process-level series, published alongside the readiness ones rather than instead of them.
 *
 * This service renders readiness per scrape, so document 17's one-snapshot rule holds here
 * unchanged and nothing below restates a readiness condition. risk-engine and trading-desk carry
 * the same class for the opposite reason — neither can run its readiness check at scrape frequency,
 * so process metrics are all their `/metrics` has.
 *
 * Heap against its ceiling is the load-bearing pair, and this service is the reason the pair
 * matters. It is the largest process on box 1 at 142 MB resident against a 96 MB heap ceiling: the
 * Oracle driver and the memory-mapped GeoLite databases sit outside the heap, so resident memory
 * exceeds the ceiling and lowering that ceiling would free almost nothing.
 *
 * Which is exactly why [heapPeak] and [heapPostGc] are worth having here despite that. They cannot
 * make this ceiling worth lowering — the footprint is not heap — but they are what says so with
 * evidence rather than by assertion, and they keep the next reader from cutting a ceiling that is
 * already below the process's own resident memory. The JVM keeps the high-water mark itself, so
 * neither number needs a fast series to be read correctly, which matters because the collection
 * being stood up is off-box on a five-minute interval and a heap sawtooths between collections.
 *
 * This service is also behind the estate's only authenticated proxy, so a hosted collector reaches
 * it with a credential the other four do not need.
