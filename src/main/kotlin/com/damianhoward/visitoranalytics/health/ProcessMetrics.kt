/**
 * Process-level series, published alongside the readiness ones rather than instead of them.
 *
 * This service renders readiness per scrape, so document 17's one-snapshot rule holds here
 * unchanged and nothing below restates a readiness condition. risk-engine and trading-desk carry
 * the same class for the opposite reason — neither can run its readiness check at scrape frequency,
 * so process metrics are all their `/metrics` has.
 *
 * Heap against its ceiling is the load-bearing pair, and this service is the reason the pair
 * matters. It is the largest process on box 1 at 142 MB resident against a 96 MB heap ceiling: the
 * Oracle driver and the memory-mapped GeoLite databases sit outside the heap, so resident memory
 * exceeds the ceiling and lowering that ceiling would free almost nothing. It was also the last of
 * the five services with no heap series at all, which left the estate unable to size its ceiling
 * from anything but a single reading taken by hand.
